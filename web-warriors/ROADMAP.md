## 🕷️ CORE GAME MECHANICS TO GENERATE (3D)

### 2. Spider Player System (3D)
**Generate a fully 3D spider character with:**
- A **3D spider model** with animations (idle, walk, jump, shoot web)
- Third-person camera system positioned behind and above the spider
- Movement mechanics for walking, climbing, and jumping in a 3D space
- Web shooting mechanics with physics (target objects using raycasting)
- Collision detection with terrain, walls, and objects
- Health and stamina systems (e.g., stamina for web swinging)

### 3. 3D Environment System
**Generate a detailed household environment in 3D:**
- Rooms with furniture, walls, and interactive objects
- Dynamic lighting and shadows for realism
- Physics-based interaction with objects (e.g., knocking over cups)
- Day/night cycle affecting lighting and gameplay
- Fly and NPC behavior in a 3D space
- Hazardous elements such as falling objects or moving vacuum cleaners

### 4. Web Physics Engine (3D)
**Generate a 3D web system:**
- Physics-based web shooting with raycasting for accuracy
- Web attachment to surfaces (walls, ceilings, objects)
- Realistic web-swinging physics with momentum and inertia
- Web visibility and rendering in 3D
- Interactions with objects (e.g., pulling objects with webs)
- Strategic web placement for traversal and defense
